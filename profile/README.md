# Disclaimer for Export Control

This all repositories under this organization are subject to [export control regulations](https://volkswagen-net.de/wikis/spaces/Cariad/pages/3429467187/Export+Control+of+software+technology). All user roles have to ensure compliance with all applicable foreign trade and export control regulations. This includes the foreign trade law of the Federal Republic of Germany, the export control and sanctions law of the European Union (EU) (in particular Regulation (EU) 2021/821) and the export control and sanctions regulations of the United States of America (USA). Accordingly, all user roles have to inform themselves about the applicable foreign trade and export control regulations before using github.com. For employees of CARIAD SE, this can be found [here](https://volkswagen-net.de/wikis/display/Cariad/Export+Control).

Servers of github.com are located on US. As a result, uploading non-physical goods (e.g. software) from the EU to git.hub.com always constitutes an export in the sense of export controls. Thus, before uploading the non-physical good, it always must be checked whether this good is subject to export controls. If the non-physical good is uploaded to github.com, this good is then an US item within the meaning of US (re-)export control regulations. This means that the uploaded good is then also subject to US (re-)export control regulations. If the uploaded non-physical good is e.g. to be made accessible to persons outside the USA, e.g. within the framework of user rights, US nexus must therefore always be checked in addition and in advance.
